This is going to document my plan for the actual network script and how it will send/receive messages

Every N scans, we will try to pull the IP list from the main server again. We will do this via a database to keep the network stuff simple

Each scan, we will have all messages go out the same randomly chosen port. This will make our sniff function easier I think


Main loop...
	check if the local buffer size is above some number. If it is, block for lock acquire
		Write all data to DB. 
		If the write fails, maintain the data in the local buffer. Otherwise, get rid of it

	check if its time for next scan. If it is, call the scan function

Each scan...
	random port chosen
	async sniffer started
	every packet sent out using custom send function
	After some timeout, the scanner is stopped

Async sniffer function:
	If the packet is a SYN ACK, then send an ACK and then a custom packet for the server information
	If the packet is a response to the custom server information, then run the log data function

custom send function:
	Block for send lock acquire
	Block until the previousPacketSendTime is at least INTERVAL in the past
	Send the packet
	update previousPacketSendTime
	release send lock


log data function:
	Block for data lock
	Write to local buffer
	release data lock
